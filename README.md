CWRU Data Analytics Module One Challenge

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

The project involved learning about pivot tables, filters, aggregation and visualization via line graphs using excel with a data set that included approximately 4,000 entertainment events where pledges of cash were made over a range of time.  The events included a variety of events including, for example, theatere, film, web and restaurants.


### Purpose

The purpose of the challenge was to exercise our skills with using excel in a variety of ways to summarize, aggregate, pivot and view the data - including date conversions. 

## Analysis and Challenges

The analysis involved converting Unix dates to typical calendar dates and months;  aggregating totals within a set of $5,000 ranges; determining the % success of the campaigns vs goals and plotting the results as png lne graphs. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

A bit tricky with "COUNTIFS" rather than "COUNTIF", but otherwise straightforward. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?   Success rates are much higher in late spring and early summer whereas failure rates are relatively flat 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?  Unsure - the success rates seem higher at lower cas rates than higher but ther eis a bump around #5k-$40k

- What are some limitations of this dataset?  It doesn't include causal factors 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?  variations due to currency and country, for example
